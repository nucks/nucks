### Hi, I'm Cameron 👨‍💻

My closest friends call me Nucks 👊

---

Here's a short history of what I've been working on the past few years:

**2017-2018**: I worked with a great team to give SMB's access to data like never before at [Grow.com](https://grow.com). <br/>
**2018-2020**: I co-founded a SaaS startup, [Unbird](https://unbird.com), and led a small team to create a tool for product managers to analyze feedback so they could know what to build, better understand their customers, and have data to back up their decisions. <br/>
**2020-2023**: I worked with an amazing team to build one of the world's top no-code platforms—[Adalo](https://adalo.com?ref=nucks-github).<br/>
**2023-current**: I'm building a company, so keep your eyes peeled 😏 <br/>

*And the best is yet to come.*
